# CSCE_5218_DEEP_LEARNING_PROJECT: Deep Learning Approach for Gender and Age Prediction Using CNN

This is a deep learning project for predicting age and gender using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Python. The model architecture is based on a research paper by Gil Levi and Tal Hassner(https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR), with slight modifications for improved performance on the UTKFace dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new).

# Repository Structure

The code in age_and_gender_prediction.ipynb loads data from the archive/UTKFace folder and processes it to predict age and gender using specified models.


# Frameworks used

TensorFlow: Used for deep learning tasks. Install with pip install tensorflow.

NumPy: Used for numerical computing. Install with pip install numpy.

Keras: Used for building neural networks. Install with pip install keras.

Matplotlib: Used for data visualization. Typically installed with other scientific computing libraries.

Seaborn: Used for statistical data visualization. Install with pip install seaborn.

tqdm: Used for creating progress bars. Install with pip install tqdm.

Pillow (not explicitly imported but used indirectly through Keras for image loading): Install with pip install pillow.
