# CSCE_5218_DEEP_LEARNING_PROJECT: Deep Learning Approach for Gender and Age Prediction Using CNN

This is a deep learning project for predicting age and gender using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Python. The model architecture is based on a research paper by Gil Levi and Tal Hassner(https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR), with slight modifications for improved performance on the UTKFace dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new).

#Repository Structure

The code in age_and_gender_prediction.ipynb loads data from the archive/UTKFace folder and processes it to predict age and gender using specified models.
